Select the form that you would like to convert to slope-intercept form:
1) Two-point form (you know two points on the line)
2) Point-slope form (you know the line's slope and one point)
=> 
Enter the x-y coordinates of the first point separated by a space=> Enter the x-y coordinates of the second point separated by a space=> 
Two-point form
      (1.00 - 3.00)
  m = --------------
      (-2.00 - 4.00)

Slope-intercept form
  y = 0.33x + 1.67
